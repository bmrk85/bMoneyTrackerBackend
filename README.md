# bMoneyTrackerBackend

This project is a spring-boot based backend application for the bMoneyTrackerGUI app.

## Purpose of the application

This application was created as my college degree thesis, this is the front-end of the application.
The purpose of the app was to create a web-app for tracking personal incomes and expenditures, 
and get a visualisation of these, or even generate an excel of the data within a specified date. 
There are some other things as well, but I won't specify all of them here.
